## Questions
* Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations? Are you able to describe how the distance detector is applying its calculations of either being safe or noting a violation?
  * No it wasn't really effective, I used a video of a baseball park pre-COVID times, but the detector failed to recognize most people on the video. I was not able to describe anything, as the detector was rarely able to recognize the people within the video. Nevertheless, the detector was effective in dectecting for people who are closer to the camera/video. 

* Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time? How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?
  * I think it is definately not effective for estimating new infection in real time, as it failed to detect a lot of people that were in the video. Also, the code itself was really slow, on average, it took about 1.5 seconds per frame for the program to process the video and took close to like 6 to 7 minutes for a 27 second video. Therefore, if we were to use it as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where social distancing information would be best to be provided LIVE.
  
* What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?
  * I would definately improve the speed of the program, but also improve on detecting people no matter how far they are from the camera.
