Sneakers are growing more popularity as they become an important part of the pop culture worldwide. With the rising popularity pushing consumers into the sneaker market, popular manufacturers such as Nike and Adidas keep a super tight control over its distribution through their apps (SNKRS and Adidas app) and their official retailers. However, with the need or the demand for these limited sneakers pushing consumers to the resale market, the resell market skyrocketed.
