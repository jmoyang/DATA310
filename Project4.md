# Plans for the Final Project 

## Problem Statement 
* Sneaker industry is a major industry of investment. According to Cowen, an investment firm, the sneaker resell market is projected to grow up to be an $30 Billion industry by 2030. Sneakers are growing more popularity as they become an important part of the pop culture worldwide. With the rising popularity pushing consumers into the sneaker market, popular manufacturers such as Nike and Adidas keep a super tight control over its distribution through their apps (SNKRS and Adidas app) and their official retailers. However, with the rising need or the demand for these limited supply sneakers pushes consumers to the resale market, increasing the need for a resell market. Over the years, we have been seeing a huge rise in the resell market. Nevertheless, there is a single question that I had, what makes the resell prices the resell prices? In other words, what variables have an impact on resell prices? Is it the color of the shoes? The model it self? Size of the shoes? or is it the popularity of the shoes? 
  * It is kind of obvious that popular shoes should be more expensive in the resell market, but I will be defining "popular" with the shoes' transaction on StockX.
