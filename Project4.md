# Plans for the Final Project 

## Problem Statement 
* Sneaker industry is a major industry of investment. According to Cowen, an investment firm, the sneaker resell market is projected to grow up to be an $30 Billion industry by 2030. Sneakers are growing more popularity as they become an important part of the pop culture worldwide. With the rising popularity pushing consumers into the sneaker market, popular manufacturers such as Nike and Adidas keep a super tight control over its distribution through their apps (SNKRS and Adidas app) and their official retailers. However, with the rising need or the demand for these limited supply sneakers pushes consumers to the resale market, increasing the need for a resell market. Over the years, we have been seeing a huge rise in the resell market. Nevertheless, there is a single question that I had, what makes the resell prices the resell prices? In other words, what variables have an impact on resell prices? Is it the color of the shoes? The model it self? Size of the shoes? or is it the popularity of the shoes? 
  * It is kind of obvious that popular shoes should be more expensive in the resell market, but I will be defining "popular" with the shoes' transaction on StockX.

## The Data
* The data I will be using is from Kaggle, but it was originally from the StockX Data Contest in 2019. It holds about 10,000 random sample data points of all OFF-White x Nike and Yeezy 350 sales between 9/1/2017 to 2/12/2019. There are 99,956 total sales in the data set, with 27,794 of them being Off-White sales and the rest of them being Yeezy sales (72,162). This data set consists of U.S sales only.
